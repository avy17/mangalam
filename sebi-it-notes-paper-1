LAN Concepts
________________________________

1. LAN works in Phy & DL layers
2. DLL is divided into 2 layers: MAC (802.3) and LLC (802.2)


IEEE Standards 802
__________________________________

802.2 std. for DL layer in OSI
802.3 std. for MAC layer using CSMA/CD
802.4 std. for MAC using token bus
802.5 std. for MAC using token ring
802.6 std. for MAN

Token Ring
______________

An empty packet (token) is circulated among all the devices. Every node waits for its turn
Data can only be send by the token holder.

======================================================

MAC address stored is stored in Canonical form i.e little endian (LSB)

10 base 2 -> 10 MBps and 2 represents maximum segment length (2*100 m)


Application layer protocols
_________________________________

SMTP: 

It is a push protocol used to send mail.
SMTP server is always on listening mode for a TCP 


DNS

Uses UDP on port 53 to serve queries.
DNS client -> DNS resolver -> DNS name server (reply back)



Networking Devices
_______________________________

Hubs: Hubs are used to connect twisted pair cables nw.Transfers data to every device connected.

Gateways: Are protocol converters. Router is a special type of gateway

Switch: Same as Hub except: it forwards packet to only the destined port and not each port by learning MAC address. It is a data link layer device. It uses packet switching method. Transmission mode is full duplex hence no collision.
Bridges: Divides a larger nw into two smaller nws by sitting bw them.

Types of Bridges
____________________

1. Transparent Bridge: Either blocks or fwd data based on MAC.
2. Source Route Bridge: Used in Token ring nw's. The entire path is stored in packet itself.
3. Translational Bridge: used to convert one format into another eg from ethernet to token ring

Routers:
Protocols used in dynamic routing: Distant vector routing & Linked state routing
__________________________________

TCP
___________

Connection: 3 way handshake

1st (client to server): SYN & SEQ(client)
2nd (server to client): SYN-ACK & SEQ(client)+1 & SEQ(server)
3rd (client to server): ACK & SEQ(client)+1 & SEQ(server)+1

Termination

1st (client to server): FIN & SEQ(client)
2nd (server to client): ACK & FIN & SEQ(client)+1 & SEQ(server)
3rd (client to server): ACK & SEQ(server)+1

IP Protocol

Connectionless. Transfers datagrams or packets
Routers uses interior/exterior gateway protocol to help reaching packets.

Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP): Eg: Routing Info. protocol (RIP), OSPF (Open shortest path first)

Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP): Border Gateway protocol

Data warehouse
_________________

Data extraction - gathering data from multiple sources.
Data Cleaning - Correcting errors.
Transformation- Converting from legacy to warehouse format.
Metadata acts as a directory that helps decision support system.

JAVA
__________

Static methods in java dont need obj to be executed. They can be called directly.

Abstract class - Used for abstraction. Abstract class can only be inherited by other class. No obj can be called.

Abstract class can have both abstract as well as regular methods.

Abstract methods can only exists in abstract class and it does not have body. Body is provided by subclass. 

Interfaces in Java: (Used to achieve abstraction/ multiple inheritance). It is a type of abstract class.

How Interfaces are different than classes?

1. Can't instantiate.
2. Doesn't contains any constructors
3. All methods are abstract.
4. It is implemented by class and not extended.
5. Interfaces can extends any no. of other interfaces.

Use of interfaces - Use to group abstract methods and achieving multiple inheritance.


Encapsulation: Data hiding. For ex: 

public class encapsulation(){
	private int a;
	
	public int geta(){
		return a;
	}
	public int seta(int newVal){
		a= newVal;
	}

}

If we dont create set function - var a cannot be modified (read only). Hence data hiding.

Final Keyword in Java
______________________

. If a var is final in java (and blank also) it can only be initialized via constructor else cannot be modified.

. If a parameter is final - cant change its value

. Eg. PAN card value

Data Structures and Algo
_____________________________
Q. How to find MST of a graph?
 
1. Create adjacency matrix.
2. Replace all diagonal 0's with degree of the vertex.
3. Replace all non-diagonal 1's with -1.
4. Calculate a11 cofactor

Divide and Conquer
__________________________

1. Merge Sort -> nlogn
2. Quick Sort -> n2 , nlogn (best case)
3. Heap Sort ->  nlogn 

Greedy Approach
___________________

1. Djkstra -> O(ElogV)   (It uses heapify to extract min) + Relax edge (E times)
2. Bellman Ford ->  O(VE)      To detect -ve cycles in a graph. 
3. Floyd Warshalls ->  O(V3)   (All pairs shortest path)
4. Prims ->  O(ElogV) 
5. Kruskal -> O(ElogV) or O(ElogE) whichever is max.
